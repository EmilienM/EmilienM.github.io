[{"content":"Read this post to learn more how to update a container in TripleO on a live system.\nNote: this might sound surgery but this is I think the clean options to patch container images in TripleO.\nYour TripleO cloud is running and you want to update an rpm in one or multiple containers?\nTripleO provides some CLI to build new container images with the rpms that you want. This procedure is also documented here.\nIn this particular example, we will update the python3-networking-ovn rpm on octavia_api.\nYou need a host to build the image: The easiest place is the Undercloud or the Standalone node, where Buildah and tripleoclient are installed. We\u0026rsquo;ll build the image from that host.\nPut your rpms in a directory: e.g. in /tmp/rpms\nExport the OpenStack admin credentials: e.g.: export OS_CLOUD=standalone Login to the registry (when using OSP): podman login registry.redhat.io Build the new container image for octavia_api: openstack tripleo container image hotfix \\ --image registry.redhat.io/rhosp-rhel8/openstack-octavia-api:16.2 \\ --rpms-path /tmp/hotfix \\ --tag 16.2-customfix \\ You should see the new image by running buildah images.\nNow you\u0026rsquo;ll need to push the image to a registry (yours, or TripleO registry): e.g. :\nbuildah push registry.redhat.io/rhosp-rhel8/openstack-octavia-api:16.2-16.2-customfix docker://quay.io/emilien/openstack-octavia-api:16.2-customfix Now, there are two methods for deploying that new image.\nRun the deploy command again, after updating the ContainerOctaviaApiImage parameter in TripleO environment Run the following steps: You need to figure out what\u0026rsquo;s the TripleO step where Octavia is deployed (it\u0026rsquo;s step 4), by looking on the host in /var/lib/tripleo-config/container-startup-config and grep for octavia_api.\nNow, go on the host where you want to use that new image (in the case of Standalone, it\u0026rsquo;s the same host where you built the image) and create an Ansible playbook with this content (e.g. paunch.yaml):\n- hosts: localhost become: true vars: service_name: octavia_api tasks: - name: Stop and clean the old container command: systemctl stop {{ service name }} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; podman rm {{ service_name }} - name: Start containers for step 1 paunch: config: /var/lib/tripleo-config/container-startup-config/step_4/hashed-{{ service_name }}.json config_overrides: octavia_api: image: quay.io/emilien/openstack-octavia-api:16.2-customfix\u0026#34; config_id: tripleo_step4 cleanup: false action: apply Change the content for your needs (different step, image, etc).\nRun Ansible with:\nansible-playbook paunch.yaml Your container is now running with your custom image (check with podman inspect).\nFor more details or help, check out the TripleO manuals or ask for help on IRC #tripleo (OFTC now).\n","permalink":"https://emilienm.github.io/blog/patching-containers-in-tripleo/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eRead this post to learn more how to update a container in TripleO on a live system.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Patching containers in TripleO"},{"content":"Hi!
