[{"content":"Stay tuned on our recent achievements in the Kubernetes and OpenStack space when running Fast-Datapath applications.\nAuthors: Emilien Macchi and Maysa Macedo.\nIn the past months, the Kubernetes Network Plumbing Working-Group added new features to the SR-IOV Network Operator for the OpenStack platform.\nIf you’re not familiar with this operator, it helps Kubernetes cluster users deploy their workloads to be connected to Fast Datapath (FDP) networking resources. While the operator is named “SR-IOV”, we’ll see that it can also manage other types of connectivity.\nIn fact, the operator helps to provision and configure the SR-IOV Network Device Plugin for Kubernetes, which is in charge of discovering and advertising networking resources for FDP, mainly (but not exclusively) for SR-IOV Virtual Functions (VFs) and PCI Physical Functions (PFs) that are available on a Kubernetes host (usually a worker node).\nThe operator hides some complexity to achieve that and provides an easy user interface.\nOpenStack metadata support The operator originally required config-drives to be enabled for the machines connected to the FDP networking, so it could read the OpenStack metadata and Network data.\nWe removed that requirement by adding support for reading that information from the Nova metadata service if no config-drive was used.\nIf your Kubernetes hosts have access to the Nova metadata URL, then you have nothing to do! Otherwise, you’ll need to make sure to create the machines with config-drive enabled.\nEnable VFIO with NOIOMMU In virtual deployments of Kubernetes where the underlying virtualization platform (e.g. QEMU) does not support a virtualized I/O memory management unit (IOMMU), the VFIO PCI driver needs to be loaded with an option named enable_unsafe_noiommu_mode enabled. This option provides user-space I/O access to a direct memory access capable device without a IOMMU.\nThe operator is now loading the driver with the right arguments so the users don’t have to worry about it.\nDPDK The operator was initially designed to work on Baremetal and not necessarily on virtualized platforms. However, when a virtualized Kubernetes host is connected to some network hardware using DPDK, the device is exposed as a virtio interface (seen as a VF by the operator) but to take advantage of DPDK, the device has to use the VFIO-PCI driver. We added support for detecting vhost-user interfaces that are connected to the specified Neutron network used for DPDK. Vhost-user is a module part of DPDK and it helps to run networking in the user-space. You can find more information here.\nHere is an example of a SriovNetworkNodePolicy that can be used for Intel devices (you’ll need to change a few things if your device is Mellanox):\napiVersion: sriovnetwork.openshift.io/v1 kind: SriovNetworkNodePolicy metadata: name: dpdk1 namespace: openshift-sriov-network-operator spec: deviceType: vfio-pci # change to netdevice if Mellanox nicSelector: netFilter: openstack/NetworkID:55a54d05-9ec1-4051-8adb-1b5a7be4f1b6 nodeSelector: feature.node.kubernetes.io/network-sriov.capable: \u0026#39;true\u0026#39; numVfs: 1 priority: 99 resourceName: dpdk1 isRdma: false # set to true if Mellanox You’ll need to configure the Network ID that matches your DPDK network in OpenStack.\nOVS Hardware Offload Open-vSwitch is CPU intensive, which affects system performance and prevents available bandwidth from being fully utilized.\nSince OVS 2.8 a feature called OVS Hardware Offload is available. It improves performance significantly by offloading tasks to the hardware running the NIC. OpenStack has full compatibility with this feature and the SR-IOV operator can now take advantage of it.\nHere is an example of a SriovNetworkNodePolicy that can be used:\napiVersion: sriovnetwork.openshift.io/v1 kind: SriovNetworkNodePolicy metadata: name: hwoffload1 namespace: openshift-sriov-network-operator spec: deviceType: netdevice nicSelector: netFilter: openstack/NetworkID:55a54d05-9ec1-4051-8adb-1b5a7be4f1b6 nodeSelector: feature.node.kubernetes.io/network-sriov.capable: \u0026#39;true\u0026#39; numVfs: 1 priority: 99 resourceName: hwoffload1 isRdma: true For now, we only support certain types of devices from the Mellanox vendor.\nAlso, you’ll need to configure the Network ID that matches your offloaded network for OpenStack.\nWrap-up The SR-IOV Network operator was extended to support essential use-cases for OpenStack, so the workloads can be using FDP features. All the features are available in the upstream operator. If you’re an OpenShift user, it’ll be available to you in the 4.11 release and backported to 4.10 in the next zstream, so stay tuned!\n","permalink":"https://my1.fr/blog/sriov-network-operator-improvements-openstack/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eStay tuned on our recent achievements in the Kubernetes and OpenStack space when running Fast-Datapath applications.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"SR-IOV network operator improvements for OpenStack"},{"content":"Read this post to learn more how to update a container in TripleO on a live system.\nNote: this might sound surgery but this is I think the clean options to patch container images in TripleO.\nYour TripleO cloud is running and you want to update an rpm in one or multiple containers?\nTripleO provides some CLI to build new container images with the rpms that you want. This procedure is also documented here.\nIn this particular example, we will update the python3-networking-ovn rpm on octavia_api.\nYou need a host to build the image: The easiest place is the Undercloud or the Standalone node, where Buildah and tripleoclient are installed. We\u0026rsquo;ll build the image from that host.\nPut your rpms in a directory: e.g. in /tmp/rpms\nExport the OpenStack admin credentials: e.g.: export OS_CLOUD=standalone Login to the registry (when using OSP): podman login registry.redhat.io Build the new container image for octavia_api: openstack tripleo container image hotfix \\ --image registry.redhat.io/rhosp-rhel8/openstack-octavia-api:16.2 \\ --rpms-path /tmp/hotfix \\ --tag 16.2-customfix \\ You should see the new image by running buildah images.\nNow you\u0026rsquo;ll need to push the image to a registry (yours, or TripleO registry): e.g. :\nbuildah push registry.redhat.io/rhosp-rhel8/openstack-octavia-api:16.2-16.2-customfix docker://quay.io/emilien/openstack-octavia-api:16.2-customfix Now, there are two methods for deploying that new image.\nRun the deploy command again, after updating the ContainerOctaviaApiImage parameter in TripleO environment Run the following steps: You need to figure out what\u0026rsquo;s the TripleO step where Octavia is deployed (it\u0026rsquo;s step 4), by looking on the host in /var/lib/tripleo-config/container-startup-config and grep for octavia_api.\nNow, go on the host where you want to use that new image (in the case of Standalone, it\u0026rsquo;s the same host where you built the image) and create an Ansible playbook with this content (e.g. paunch.yaml):\n- hosts: localhost become: true vars: service_name: octavia_api tasks: - name: Stop and clean the old container command: systemctl stop {{ service name }} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; podman rm {{ service_name }} - name: Start containers for step 1 paunch: config: /var/lib/tripleo-config/container-startup-config/step_4/hashed-{{ service_name }}.json config_overrides: octavia_api: image: quay.io/emilien/openstack-octavia-api:16.2-customfix\u0026#34; config_id: tripleo_step4 cleanup: false action: apply Change the content for your needs (different step, image, etc).\nRun Ansible with:\nansible-playbook paunch.yaml Your container is now running with your custom image (check with podman inspect).\nFor more details or help, check out the TripleO manuals or ask for help on IRC #tripleo (OFTC now).\n","permalink":"https://my1.fr/blog/patching-containers-in-tripleo/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eRead this post to learn more how to update a container in TripleO on a live system.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Patching containers in TripleO"},{"content":"Have a look at how we can move container images from the docker.io registry to quay.io.\nThanks to Skopeo, we can copy container images from one registry to another.\nIn this post, we\u0026rsquo;ll copy images from docker.io to quay.io, a container registry which has a lot of features that docker.io doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide.

The retry mechanism is to workaround the 500 error that you might get when it provisions a new repository, and it says it already exists (sounds specific to how the registry receives authentication from Skopeo vs Docker CLI).

Thank you to all of them!. I also would like to thank Colette Alexander who made this happen.\nIn this blog post, I’ll explain what I’ve learned and also what I took away during this training but also my career; also I’ll give some personal opinions that only engage myself and nobody else.\nFour {Levels, Stages} of Learning Being a leader starts with the willingness of learning. Let’s start by the four levels of learning:\nListening, Reflecting, Assimilating and acting, Teaching (Repeat)\nThe things mentioned during the training were very close of how I personally learned how to be an Open-Source contributor. It starts by listening around you. It has been a little bit frustrating for me at the beginning to not being able to quickly take actions when new ideas come up, but being patient is really worth it.\nThe time to reflect is important to assimilate what happens out there: “what people do” and “why”, “how to they work together” and “how my contribution would fit in there” are the biggest questions I ask myself most of the time I’m jumping into something new for me.\nThen it’s time for actions. That time is really interesting because it’s very exiting at the beginning when contributing for the first time to a project, but can also be frustrating when getting the first feedback of this contribution. It’s like an “emotional elevator” where you go from total happiness of finally feeling useful in this project to “I’m so frustrated, the way I proposed my idea was rejected, I just want to thrash everything and run away”. This moment is to me very crucial and usually I manage to get my frustration out by going for a run or do some other activities that I like. Coming back on keyboard, I take time to retrospect and see how can I do better the next time.\nNow you’re part of the project and you know how to contribute, the work is not finished. Quite some times I see some projects where it’s hard to join the team because there is simply nobody willing to take time and explain you the really basics. Note: on the other side, it also comes with the capacity of saying “I don’t know” (yeah it happens, period.) and learners have to be ready to be mentored. Anyway, if you know something, teach it so more people will know it and your project will remain a cool place to work for.\nLet’s talk about the four stages of the learning journey.\nIt starts by being Unconsciously Incompetent. You underestimate the skills required to contribute and you jump into this hole without knowing that it’s not going to be easy. This stage is usually fast when you become consciously incompetent and realize it won’t be so easy. Don’t give up and go learning, you’ll become unconsciously incompetent (when you start to be productive and teach what you’ve learned). And then it comes the time to be consciously competent. If you didn’t start to teach the skill to someone else, it’s never to late to do it. If you want to read my personal experience of being a Project Lead in OpenStack community, I wrote a blog post that mentions these Learning steps.\nThe importance of a vision There are different versions out there of what is a Vision. A Vision is not a Mission Statement nor a Strategic Plan. My definition from what I’ve seen and learned over the last years would be: “a vision tells a successful story about what you want to be and where you want to go”.\nAn effective Vision is:\nwritten collectively (where all individuals part of the story can contribute) inspiring people who work with you but also externals strategically sound documented and communicated It starts by taking your pen and write yourself on paper your first draft. I find it important to highlight “you” and “draft” because to me a good Vision takes time and iterations to be well written by yourself and not by any consultant.\nDuring the training, for the first time I wrote a vision of my life in 1 year and I found the exercise interesting. Also, when I came back I started this work with my team at Red Hat. So far it has been very helpful to document where the team wants to go.\nGood Leaders offer great service to staff A good Leader is not a boss, nor a Chief. A Leader is an human who makes the best as possible to serve a team who work on a common purpose. During my last 5 years, people who inspired me were Leaders in some sorts. They help others to be better, share their knowledge, accept failures and learn from them.\nTo me, a good Leader is someone able to drive a project to success without taking any decision, but instead, influence her / his peers by engaging collaboration to make the work happen.\nSomething we learned during the training: Power = 1 / ( Authority x Frequency of use )\nAlso two things I’ve learned over the last years and also were confirmed during the training:\nMultitasking doesn’t work. Being a Leader doesn’t mean you have to be busier than others so you can do multiple things in the same time. First of all: everyone is busy (period again.); Second: it’s impossible for the most common brains to perform in a successful way multiple tasks at the same time. High performing has nothing to do with skills. It’s a matter of how much your team shares a common understanding at how they can work together for a specific purpose (“It’s easy to do the right thing, but hard to do the bad things”). Working fourteen hours per day is not efficient and knowing everything doesn’t mean you’re a good Leader. Bottom-line change is leadership I’m convinced that it exists multiple methods to be a great leader and bring new ideas. One of them might be the BLC (Bottom-line change). It appears to be useful when you (leader) wants to bring a new idea in your team.\nFirst of all, you need to make sure you’ll have some time to dedicate because people won’t always buy your idea so quickly. You need to prepare your idea: write some background, define a problem to solve, and if possible get some valid data to justify your proposal.\nOne of the key things is to get the right people involved in your idea. If your idea is a new feature, get all stakeholders involved (one person per group is enough), and rewrite the idea with them, so all of them agree on it. This step is very useful so when you’ll present results, people will recognize their interests since you asked to the right people. Engage the microcosm to work on the vision and prepare a plan for the change. Share the results with your team and help them to implement the change by giving support and accept feedback.\nAs a conclusion, I would define Leadership as a skill that you can’t learn only in the books (but some books are very useful like Being a Better Leader). You need to practice, try, fail, retrospect and try again. Being a leader in some tasks is very rewarding and in my opinion sometimes reduces frustration. At least but not least, being a good leader and going the extra-mile can be to create new leaders around you by sharing techniques, trusting and promoting people. Have fun!\n","permalink":"https://my1.fr/blog/what-leadership-means-to-me/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI finally took some time to write some thoughts about what Leadership means to me.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"What Leadership Means To Me"},{"content":"This story explains why I started to stop working as a anarchistic-multi-tasking-schedule-driven and learnt how to become a good team leader.\nHow it started March 2015, Puppet OpenStack project just moved under the Big Tent. What a success for our group!\nOne of the first step was to elect a Project Team Lead. Our group was pretty small (~10 active contributors) so we thought that the PTL would be just a facilitator for the group, and the liaison with other projects that interact with us. I mean, easy, right?\nAt that time, I was clearly an unconsciously incompetent PTL. I thought I knew what I was doing to drive the project to success.\nBut situation evolved. I started to deal with things that I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect to deal with like making sure our team works together in a way that is efficient and consistent. I also realized nobody knew what a PTL was really supposed to do (at least in our group), so I took care of more tasks, like release management, organizing Summit design sessions, promoting core reviewers, and welcoming newcomers. That was the time where I realized I become a consciously incompetent PTL. I was doing things that nobody taught me before.\nIn fact, there is no book telling you how to lead an OpenStack project so I decided to jump in this black hole and hopefully I would make mistakes so I can learn something.\nSet your own expectations I made the mistake of engaging myself into a role where expectations were not cleared with the team. The PTL guide is not enough to clear expectations of what your team will wait from you. This is something you have to figure out with the folks you\u0026rsquo;re working with. You would be surprised by the diversity of expectations that project contributors have for their PTL. Talk with your team and ask them what they want you to be and how they see you as a team lead. I don\u0026rsquo;t think there is a single rule that works for all projects, because of the different cultures in OpenStack community.\nEmbrace changes … and accept failures. There is no project in OpenStack that didn\u0026rsquo;t had outstanding issues (technical and human). The first step as a PTL is to acknowledge the problem and share it with your team. Most of the conflicts are self-resolved when everyone agrees that yes, there is a problem. It can be a code design issue or any other technical disagreement but also human complains, like the difficulty to start contributing or the lack of reward for very active contributors who aren\u0026rsquo;t core yet. Once a problem is resolved: discuss with your team about how we can avoid the same situation in the future. Make a retrospective if needed but talk and document the output.\nI continuously encourage at welcoming all kind of changes in TripleO so we can adopt new technologies that will make our project better.\nKeep in mind it has a cost. Some people will disagree but that\u0026rsquo;s fine: you might have to pick a rate of acceptance to consider that your team is ready to make this change.\nDelegate We are humans and have limits. We can\u0026rsquo;t be everywhere and do everything. We have to accept that PTLs are not supposed to be online 24/7. They don\u0026rsquo;t always have the best ideas and don\u0026rsquo;t always take the right decisions. This is fine. Your project will survive.\nI learnt that when I started to be PTL of TripleO in 2016. The TripleO team has become so big that I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize how many interruptions I would have every day. So I decided to learn how to delegate. We worked together and created TripleO Squads where each squad focus on a specific area of TripleO. Each squad would be autonomous enough to propose their own core reviewers or do their own meetings when needed. I wanted small teams working together, failing fast and making quick iterations so we could scale the project, accept and share the work load and increase the trust inside the TripleO team.\nThis is where I started to be a Consciously Competent PTL.\nWhere am I now I have reached a point where I think that projects wouldn\u0026rsquo;t need a PTL to run fine if they really wanted. Instead, I start to believe about some essential things that would actually help to get rid of this role:\nAs a team, define the vision of the project and document it. It will really help to know where we want to go and clear all expectations about the project. Establish trust to each individual by default and welcome newcomers. Encourage collective and distributed leadership. Try, Do, Fail, Learn, Teach. and start again. Don\u0026rsquo;t stale. This long journey helped me to learn many things in both technical and human areas. It has been awesome to work with such groups so far. I would like to spend more time on technical work (aka coding) but also in teaching and mentoring new contributors in OpenStack. Therefore, I won\u0026rsquo;t be PTL during the next cycle and my hope is to see new leaders in TripleO, who would come up with fresh ideas and help us to keep TripleO rocking.\nThanks for reading so far, and also thanks for your trust.\n","permalink":"https://my1.fr/blog/my-journey-as-an-openstack-ptl/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis story explains why I started to stop working as a anarchistic-multi-tasking-schedule-driven and learnt how to become a good team leader.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"My Journey As An OpenStack PTL"},{"content":" My professional path is frequently updated on my Linkedin profile.
